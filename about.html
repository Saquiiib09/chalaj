<h2>ABOUT</h2>
</center><br>
<P><font size=5>The project is an authentication system that validates users for accessing the system only when they have input correct password.The project involves three levels of user authentication.There are verieties of password systems available,may of which have failed due to bot attacks while few have sustained it but to alimit.In short almost all the passwords available today can be broken into a limit
Hence we decided to design a project which is aimed to achieve the highest security in authenticating users.It contains three logins having three different kinds of password systemThe password difficulty increases with each level user have to input correct password for successfull login.Users would be given privilege to set passwords according to their wish.
The project comprises of text password i.e pass phrase,color based pattern password and one time password (OTP) sent to their registered mail id/mobile numbers for the three levels respectively
this way there would me neglegible chances of bot or anyone to crack passwords even if they have cracked the first level or second level,it would be impossible to crack the third one.
Many users find the most wide spread text based password systems unfriendly.So in the case of three levelpassword we tried creating a simple user interface and providing users with the best possible comfir in solving password.
